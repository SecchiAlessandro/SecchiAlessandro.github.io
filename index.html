                                        <p>Over the past month (August 2024), I’ve found inspiration from various sources, both privately and professionally. Inspiration to start a new chapter of my life. I’ve been reminded of the importance of certain emotions: inspiration and motivation, which are fundamental drivers for uncovering life’s mysteries and fostering innovation.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>These events, along with my months spent on-site in Tanzania and my visit to Silicon Valley, have triggered some reflections that I’d like to write down to better organize my thoughts.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>In “Thus Spoke Zarathustra,” the last metamorphosis of the spirit is represented by the “child,” a symbol of creativity, spontaneity, playfulness, and openness. At this stage, one begins to wonder about everything again but with a fresh perspective. What are the unresolved mysteries of life? Who does he want to be in 10 years? What is consciousness?..</p>
                                        
                                        <blockquote>"He who has a why to live can bear almost any how."</blockquote>
                                        
                                        <p>Thus, he starts exploring different aspects of his life, trying to push beyond apparent limitations. He lives multiple stories, encounters new cultures, begins new studies—driven by the desire to fill a void or bridge a gap. He is always careful to use knowledge as a means, rather than pursuing it for its own sake. Knowledge should be disinterested, not driven by a “will to power,” as it can sometimes disconnect us from the more vital, instinctual aspects of life—passion, love, and creativity.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>But how can he sustain these important aspects of life? Needs can evolve into drives, which may result in motivation. In other words, to maintain motivation, we must leave some needs unfulfilled at all times.</p>
                                        
                                        <br>
                                        <img src="assets/img/Maslow.jpg" width="800" height="600">
                                    
                                        <p>The goal—at least for me—is to remain in the state of self-actualization: what I can be, I must be. I don’t want to stray too far, but this state acknowledges the concept of linking justice to virtue (Aristotelism). Society should not just aim to maximize welfare (utilitarianism) or respect individual rights (libertarianism); it should also promote the moral character of individuals.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>I like the Maslow pyramid, as it highlights the importance of professional development and equal opportunities.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Finally, here’s a list of some quotes that often come to mind when I’m seeking inspiration. They may seem a bit trivial or loosely connected, but I believe they serve as valuable fuel for finding certain answers:</p>
                                        
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>"I think it’s possible for ordinary people to choose to be extraordinary."</li>
                                            <li>"Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life."</li>
                                            <li>"Everything around you that you call life was created by people no smarter than you, and you can influence it."</li>
                                            <li>"I think it’s very important to have a feedback loop, where you’re constantly thinking about what you’ve done and how you could be doing it better (together)."</li>
                                            <li>"The greater the risk, the greater the reward."</li>
                                            <li>"People don’t buy what you do; they buy why you do it."</li>
                                            <li>"It’s not important which company you work for, but which leader."</li>
                                            <li>"Most people don’t get experiences because they never ask."</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        
                                        <p>I want to close this train of thought with a reflection from one of the last books I read: <em>Outliers: The Story of Success.</em></p>
                                        
                                        <p>Success is a story of people who were given a special opportunity to work really hard and seized it, and who happen to come of age at a time when that extraordinary effort was rewarded by the rest of society. It is a product of history, community, opportunity, and the legacy of the world in which we grew up. We need to be aware of all these variables so as to replace the arbitrary advantages with a society that provides opportunities for all.</p>
                                        
                                        <h2>Here are some of the sources of inspiration I mentioned earlier:</h2>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The kickoff of my studies in management and economics.</li>
                                            <li>Training sessions with service engineers from around the world in Switzerland.</li>
                                            <li>A volleyball weekend training event with team-building activities.</li>

                                    <h3 class="mb-0">Back from Anglogold commissioning in Tanzania</h3>
                                     
                                       
                                         
                                    <br>  
                                         <p> On my way back home, I tried to write down my reflections about the past three months in Tanzania, where we supported the partial electrification of the Geita Gold Mine.</p>
                                        
                                          <br>  
                                          <br> 
                                    
                                        <p>𝐒𝐨𝐦𝐞 𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐬 𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭:</p>
                                     <p>🏭 The mine currently receives 40MW of power from 4 Wärtsilä diesel generators located on-site.</p>
                                     <p>🔌 In 2020, the mine embarked on a grid integration project to build a 33/11kV 60MVA substation connected to the national 220/33kV grid at Mpomvu village, which will also provide power to other 130 villages in the region.</p>
                                     <p>💡 Given the complex operational requirements of the process plant and the weak grid, there is a crucial need for a reliable and secure power supply. That's why a Static Synchronous Compensator is necessary to provide dynamic voltage compensation to support the 33kV bus during grid faults and to regulate its power factor.</p>
                                     <p>🔋 With about 235 GWh/year of energy demand and an average CO2 emissions from the electrical grid of 0.27 kg/kwh (powered by 35% of renewable energy), this project will bring a reduction from 0,14 Mt to 0,063 Mt.</p>
                                     <p>💸 The mine's annual energy expenditure will drastically decrease, with a NPV of 26 million, IIR 46% (over 10 years) and payback period of the investment in less than 2 years.</p>
                                     <br>  
                                     <br>  
                                     <p>𝐒𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐢𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐬𝐞𝐞𝐦𝐬 𝐬𝐨 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠, 𝐢𝐭 𝐦𝐚𝐝𝐞 𝐦𝐞 𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 𝐟𝐮𝐫𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫:</p>
                                     <p>🌎 OCSE countries are accountable for 1/3 of the C02 emissions and in the last 10 years they had a yearly reduction of about 1%.</p>
                                     <p>🔥 Global Emissions continue to rise, reaching a new record of 37.4 Gt in 2023.</p>
                                     <p>💸 Out of $1.8 trillion of clean energy investments in 2023, developing economies account for about 15% (and they represent roughly a third of global GDP and two-thirds of the world's population).</p>
                                     <p>⛏️ Critical minerals are pivotal for the energy transition and areas like Africa owns over 40% of global reserves.</p>
                                     <br>  
                                     <br>  
                                     <p>𝐈𝐧 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧:</p>
                                    <p>🟢 I wonder if substantial investments in the electrical grids of OCSE countries is the fastest and most effective way to addressing the global climate crisis and achieving the famous net zero emissions.</p>
                                    <p>🟢 Perhaps exporting cutting-edge technology and expertise to developing countries, that are in the middle of their industrial revolution, could offer a possible answer to the "hard problem" of the energy transition.</p>
                                    <p>🟢 Wouldn’t it be better to reconsider (and readapt) the past approach of clean development mechanism CDM from the Kyoto protocol to valorize these investments?</p>

                                     <br>  
                                    <p>...Back to my experience in Tanzania 🇹🇿. The humbleness of the people I have met and their respect for nature have thought me that this energy transition might have even more relevance in those places, where nature is still part of daily life and people know how to praise it.
                                        As they told me as soon as I arrived at Mchauru Village: “Welcome back to the reality”. 😄</p>
                                    
                                
                                         <br>
                                         <br>
                                         <br>
                                                                                  
                                    
                                    

                                     <p>🏭 Investing in developing countries could be an effective way to fight global warming. However, at the same time, we should work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions per capita in places like the US and Europe, where levels are much higher than in the rest of the world. </p>
                                    <br>  
                                    <br>  
                                    <p>𝐀𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐦𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 𝐛𝐞 𝐚𝐧 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧 𝐛𝐢𝐠𝐠𝐞𝐫 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦:</p>
                                     <p>💸 Direct investments in the transmission and distribution system, as well as in the ancillary services (primary and secondary markets, capacity markets, FACTS, etc.) need a clear evaluation and communication to the citizen since it might lead to substation increase in their bills. </p>
                                     <p>🌄 The case of the German corridors in striking. The costs associated with transmitting high-voltage energy from wind generation in the North to consumption areas in the South amount to several tens of euros per MWh. These costs should be added to the production price at auctions (so-called "grid parity") and also include additional surcharges to maintain the quality and safety of the electrical service.</p>
                                     <p>OCSE countries should take the lead in this energy transition as they can reduce the so-called green premiums by investing in new innovations.</p>
                                     <p>🟢 Perhaps promoting and reviewing the concept of grid parity, which cannot solely refer to the local cost of production but must include additional costs to the electricity system. 
                                        For example, nodal pricing, which redistributes some costs associated with the location and intermittency of PV production could be considered.
                                        This would foster the rise of Virtual Power Plants (VPPs), where by aggregating the interests of around a hundred households into a mini plant of a few hundred kilowatts, the cost of producing one kWh could be reduced by two-thirds (kind of car pooling but with energy ☀️).</p>

                                     <br>
                                     <p>We know that the Energy Transition is quite a complex problem, but the book “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster” helped me to grasp it in smaller and clearer solutions, which I try to summarize here:</p>
                                     <p>🏭 The world typically adds 52 billion tons of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere every year.  </p>
                                     <br>
                                    This includes:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>30% from “making things” (mainly cement, steel, plastic)</li>
                                            <li>26% from “plugging in” (electricity)</li>
                                            <li>21% from “growing things” (plants, animals)</li>
                                            <li>16% from “getting around” (planes. Truck, cargo ships)</li>
                                            <li>7% from “keeping warm and cool” (heating, cooling, refrigeration)</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    <br>
                                     <p>🌍 The world needs to provide more energy without releasing any greenhouse gases so the poorest can thrive.</p>
                                     <p>👪 The population growth goes down as we improve health.</p>
                                     <p>⚡️ Electricity demand will increase also driven by new ways of making cement and plastic.</p>

                                     <p>🟢 Get that electricity from clean energy sources (including next generation nuclear fission and nuclear fusion).</p>                              
                                     <p>🟢 Use carbon capture to absorb remaining emissions (possibly directly from power plants, as some national agencies are already demanding).</p>
                                     <p>🟢 Discuss and understand the impact of geoengineering (brightening clouds and injecting fine particles into the atmosphere).</p>
                                     <p>🟢 Government policies to close the gap, as energy businesses spend an average of 0.3% on R&D compared to the 10% of IT and pharma industries.</p>

                                        <p>A few months ago, I wanted to start some AI projects to better understand its potential and see if it could really assist me.</p>

                                        <p>1) Regarding foundation models (LLMs), nearly every week, there was an announcement about new, more powerful models from different companies. Sorting them out was quite straightforward:
                                        <br>
                                        📖 Open-source models (>70B parameters):
                                        <br>
                                        Llama (Meta) vs. Grok (xAI from Elon) vs. Mistral AI (largest European LLM) vs. Falcon (Abu Dhabi TII)
                                        <br>                  
                                        <br>🔐 Private models (>70B parameters):
                                        <br>
                                        GPT (OpenAI/Microsoft) vs. Gemini (Google) vs. paLM (Google) vs. Claude (Anthropic) vs. Olympus (Amazon) vs. Ernie (Baidu, Inc. - China).</p>

                                        <p>2) Then I started to look into open-source models that allow me to customize my application and maybe run it on my local machine.</p>
                                        
                                        💻So, I began exploring LLMs that can run locally, using tools like:
                                        LMStudio vs. Ollama vs. GPT4All.
                                        
                                        <p>Of course, my laptop can only handle LLMs with &lt;7B parameters, but for initial experiments, I thought this would be more than enough.</p>
                                        
                                        <br>
                                        
                                        <p>3) The next step was to look for basic LLM frameworks and repositories from this new AI world:</p>
                                        
                                        ⛓ From Langchain and LlamaIndex (for Python and JavaScript) to Relevance AI and Make.com (for low-code solutions).
                                        
                                        <p>As a good starting point, I decided to explore some pre-built open-source projects and here, I was astonished by the thousands of open-source projects publicly shared every day on GitHub and Hugging Face (the GitHub for LLMs).</p>
                                        
                                        <br>
                                        
                                        <p>4) Among them, I tried:</p>
                                        
                                        AutoGPT (linked with OpenAI) vs. HuggingGPT (integrated with models from Hugging Face) vs. AutoGen (a multi-agent project that supports function calling to extend the capabilities of the model by generating documents, sending emails, etc.).
                                        
                                        <p>Testing these projects was inspiring, but I must be honest. They are still prototypes with bugs that require new daily releases.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Naturally, their closed-source counterparts are more reliable:</p>
                                        Azure AI Studio (a Microsoft integrated environment to develop AI agents) vs. Microsoft 365 Copilot (quite useful with Excel and Outlook) vs. OpenAI GPTs (arguably the most utilized AI playground).
                                        
                                        <p>It's also worth mentioning AI Image and Video Generation models (DALL-E 3, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Sora, Runway). See the breakthrough experiment from Reid Hoffman.</p>
                                        
                                        <br>
                                        
                                        <p>5) Finally, I opted for an AI open-source IDE that allowed me to develop and connect objects (nodes and graphs). Tools like Flowwise, Langlow, but especially Rivet, are great for visualizing and building complex chains and create production-ready applications.</p>

                                        However, there is a remarkable boost in R&D and academic activities, and a huge benefit for developers who can use AI copilots to build their software or create simple websites (https://secchialessandro.github.io/).
                                        For a company business, it would be interesting to explore solutions such as Azure AI Studio with some open source LLMs models.</p>
                                         <p>🟢 We are moving towards highly specialized small agents in a multi-agent and multimodal frameworks. The new GPT-4o just leaves space to the imagination 🤯.</p>                              
                                         <p>🟢 It is worth to mention the so called large action model "LAM" (see Rabbit r1). Check out the new open source project from Microsoft "Visualization-of-Thought (VoT) Elicits Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models".</p>
                                         <p>🟢 If you aim to use open-source LLMs, maintain the privacy of your data, and run useful applications, you could do so from your own laptop (with limited complexity) or from an internal server if you're a business.</p>                                     
                                         <p>🌟 I am convinced that we are getting closer and closer and I will spend some time to seek for opportunities between this new AI world and my passion in Energy.
                                             <br>Some friends have already introduced new methods to operate in the electricity market. For instance, Matteo Pisani developed a model to regulate the voltage from a load tap changer using reinforcement learning algorithms (reducing unnecessary tap movements, thus maintenance costs of the device).

                                            Working at one of the Hitachi companies, gave me the inspiration to build a multiagent framework to exploit the huge amount of knowledge in information technology (IT) business as well as the operational technology (OT), a special combination that only a few companies can afford.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            Therefore, by looking at the Lumada concept, I tried to build an application with LangGraph, where each agent is trained on the respective company data (scraped from the website section: products and solutions) 
                                            and the supervisor (LumadaAI) can choose a specific agent (company) to perform the RAG (retrieval augmented generation) on the training data. 
                                            In addition, I have added two agents called "Researcher" and "Coder" to perform a general web search and basic data analysis calculations.

                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            In this framework, each agent is a node in the graph, and their connections are represented as an edge. The control flow is managed by edges, and they communicate by adding to the graph's state.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            With LangGraph I could create a cyclical and non-linear workflows where the agents can revisit and refine their actions based on new data, leading to more accurate and efficient outcomes. 
                                            <b>Specialization, collaboration, flexibility and scalability</b> are the main advantages of this kind of multi-agent systems.

                            <p> 
                                I am a power electronics engineer at Hitachi Energy's Global Center of Competence in Turgi (Switzerland), working within 
                                the business line Grid Integration, Power Quality Solutions (PGGI, GPQS). Typically, I deal with medium power converters for different applications (Rail, distribution grids, mines, offshore platforms..).
                                Over the last couple of years, my primary focus has been on the Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM), from its software
                                development and HIL testing to the site commissioning. 
                                <br> It's a cool job that allows me to take many resposabilities.
                                <br> At times, I see our unit as a start-up with a hundred years of expertise.
                                We are about 15 control software engineers, fortunate to be deeply engaged in the whole design of these medium-power converters,
                                including sales support, electrical design, software development, on-site commissioning and service. 
                                But the most interesting part is that, our solutions (NPC PCS6000 and MMC) are evolving projects following market and customer requirements. So, we 
                                are actually part of this fantastic Energy Transition! 🌍🌿 <br>

                            <p> 
                                I worked as an R&D engineer at the automotive division of Schaffner Group. There, I designed and assembled an Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) filter for an electric hypercar 🏎️. 
                                I had the privilege to experience the main phases of the product development before its mass production (design simulations, prototyping, testing and validation).
                                I was also lucky that my manager taught me the importance of leadership.. ("𝑰𝒕 𝒊𝒔 𝒏𝒐𝒕 𝒊𝒎𝒑𝒐𝒓𝒕𝒂𝒏𝒕 𝒘𝒉𝒊𝒄𝒉 𝒄𝒐𝒎𝒑𝒂𝒏𝒚 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒇𝒐𝒍𝒍𝒐𝒘, 𝒃𝒖𝒕 𝒘𝒉𝒊𝒄𝒉 𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒅𝒆𝒓").  <br>
                                After some months, the company invited me to develop a theoretical model to predict the conductive emissions within an automotive powertrain. This novel strategy was capable of simulating the common and differential mode spectrum in just a few seconds ⚡.

                            <p> The main software I used at that time was LTspice for the electric circuit simulation, FEMM for core magnetic simulations, Altium for the PCB design, and other instruments such 
                                as the vector network analyzer and the impedance analyzer.</p>

                                During the Covid period, I spent a lot of time in my room, but it was also a time when I met many interesting new people.
                                In fact, I became a passionate YouTube host, organizing webinars dedicated to the energy and automotive sectors. 
                                With our student association (EMS), we successfully engaged top industries and universities, attracting over 2000 live viewers.<br>
                                We had insightful discussions about the European Green Deal and hydrogen with experts like Guido Bortoni and Alessandro Clerici. 
                                Additionally, we hosted inspiring talks with representatives from the Stellantis Group, Tesla Owners, ENEA, FAST, WEC Italy, RSE, AEIT, and ABB.

                                <br>💡 Inspiring and insightful opportunity to understand the mindset among the entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley.
                                After the tour, I embarked on a solo trip to Los Angeles, Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon, and New York.
                                <br> Those months have been truly memorable, both personally and professionaly. I guess I will write some reflections
                                about that genuine ambition I have experienced in SF, maybe with some thoughts about AI and Energy 🚀.

                                            I believe that our life has plenty of incredible mysteries that we can only uncover by meeting new cultures 🤝.
                                            <br>At just 14 years old, I embarked on a transformative journey to Malaysia, living with an Asian family.
                                            <br>Later, I found myself in Brighton, England, working in a traditional fish and chips, trying to pay back my summer holiday with my best friend Francesco. 
                                            <br> Also during my studies, I have shared my accommodation with international students (from Vietnam, Poland, France, Egypt, Russia, and China). <br>During this time, I had the privilege of acting in a short film crafted by my talented flatmate, Yuchen, a budding director. Our collaboration earned recognition at the Macau International Short Film Festival.

                                            I have been playing volleyball since I was 10 years old 🏐. Currently, I am the setter of the Kanti Baden first league team. <br>
                                            Over the past year we strive to break into the national league, coming close last season but narrowly missing out in the tie break..<br>
                                            ..When I'm not on the volleyball court, you can find me practicing in table tennis 🏓.

                                                When I'm feeling inspired, I play the piano. I play few classical songs and some neo-classical composers such as Einaudi, Grinko, Yann Tiersen.. At the moment, I am studying K397 Fantasie in D Minor from Mozart, even though my ultimate goal is Clair de Lune from Debussy 🎹.
                                                <br>
                                                The video below is quite a memorable moment of mine. I was with my friend (still Francesco) at the train station, improvising some piano songs. We were both 17 years old at the time, returning from a summer camp. It was a fun experience though, we even earned some decent money from it.

                                            <br> Over the years, I've been lucky enough to meet exceptional people
                                            who have become both my friends and mentors.

                                            Also, I enjoy participating in various associations as I believe it's the most effective way to learn, share, and have fun! Currently, I am involved in NOVA Talent and Lead The Feature (mentoring and networking groups), as well as AEIT (Italian Electrotechnical Association).
