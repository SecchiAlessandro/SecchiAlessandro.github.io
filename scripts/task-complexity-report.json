      "taskTitle": "Prepare and organize placeholder images",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of preparing and organizing placeholder images into subtasks covering: 1) directory creation and setup, 2) sourcing and processing the images, and 3) verification and optimization steps.",
      "reasoning": "This task is relatively straightforward with clear steps. The complexity is low as it involves standard file operations and image processing. The task is well-defined with specific requirements for directory structure, naming conventions, and image specifications."

      "taskTitle": "Identify insertion point in index.html",
      "complexityScore": 2,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of identifying the insertion point in index.html into subtasks covering: 1) analyzing the HTML structure and documenting the 'Thoughts' section, and 2) determining and marking the optimal insertion point with appropriate documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This is a simple analysis task with minimal technical complexity. It requires understanding the existing HTML structure and making a judgment about placement, but doesn't involve complex implementation. The task is well-defined and self-contained."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Create HTML structure for the album",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of creating the HTML structure for the album into subtasks covering: 1) developing the basic album container and heading, 2) implementing the image pages with proper structure for all 20 images, and 3) creating the navigation controls with appropriate attributes.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating moderately complex HTML with multiple nested elements. While the structure is provided, implementing it correctly for all 20 images requires attention to detail. The task has dependencies on previous tasks and needs to integrate with the existing page structure."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement basic CSS for album display",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of implementing basic CSS for the album into subtasks covering: 1) container and wrapper styling, 2) page display and visibility rules, 3) navigation controls styling, and 4) integration with the site's existing styles and testing for conflicts.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing moderately complex CSS with positioning, visibility controls, and interactive elements. The developer needs to ensure the styles work correctly with the HTML structure and don't conflict with existing styles. The task includes responsive considerations and visual design elements."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement JavaScript for basic page navigation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of implementing JavaScript for album navigation into subtasks covering: 1) setting up the initial state and element references, 2) implementing the page navigation logic, 3) creating the event handlers for user interaction, and 4) testing and debugging the navigation functionality.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing interactive functionality with state management, event handling, and DOM manipulation. The JavaScript needs to correctly handle edge cases (first/last page) and maintain synchronization between the visual display and internal state. The complexity is moderate as it requires careful implementation of interactive behavior."

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Style album to resemble a book",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of styling the album to resemble a book into subtasks covering: 1) implementing the book container styling, 2) creating the page appearance with appropriate shadows and effects, 3) developing the book spine visual effect, 4) enhancing the navigation controls to match the book theme, and 5) ensuring cross-browser compatibility of the book styling.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires advanced CSS techniques including pseudo-elements, shadows, gradients, and positioning to create a realistic book appearance. The visual complexity is high, requiring careful implementation of multiple visual effects that work together cohesively. Cross-browser compatibility adds additional complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Style individual album pages",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of styling individual album pages into subtasks covering: 1) implementing the base page styling with appropriate borders and shadows, 2) creating the figure and caption styling for image presentation, and 3) adding interactive effects like hover states and transitions.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves moderate CSS complexity to style individual pages with visual enhancements. It requires updating both HTML and CSS to implement figure/figcaption elements and associated styling. The task includes interactive elements and visual refinements that enhance the user experience."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement page-turning visual effect",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of implementing the page-turning visual effect into subtasks covering: 1) creating the CSS animations for forward and backward page turns, 2) updating the JavaScript navigation logic to incorporate animations, 3) handling edge cases and preventing animation conflicts, 4) implementing fallbacks for browsers with limited support, and 5) optimizing the animations for performance.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex CSS animations combined with JavaScript timing and state management. Creating a realistic page-turning effect requires 3D transforms, z-index management, and careful coordination between CSS and JavaScript. The task has multiple dependencies and requires sophisticated animation techniques with browser compatibility considerations."

      "taskTitle": "Refine overall styling and integration",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of refining overall styling and integration into subtasks covering: 1) analyzing and matching the site's design language, 2) implementing responsive design adjustments for different screen sizes, 3) ensuring visual harmony with surrounding content, and 4) conducting final visual quality assurance across devices.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires a holistic approach to ensure the album integrates seamlessly with the existing site. It involves design analysis, responsive design implementation, and careful attention to visual details. The complexity comes from needing to understand and match the site's existing design patterns while ensuring the album works well across different devices."

      "taskTitle": "Test and debug the implementation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the testing and debugging task into subtasks covering: 1) creating a comprehensive test plan for functionality and appearance, 2) implementing automated tests with Playwright-MCP, 3) conducting cross-browser compatibility testing, 4) performing responsive design and mobile testing, and 5) documenting and fixing identified issues.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves comprehensive testing across multiple dimensions: functionality, appearance, integration, performance, and compatibility. It requires setting up automated testing, manual verification across browsers and devices, and systematic debugging. The complexity is high due to the breadth of testing required and the need to identify and fix issues across the entire implementation."
